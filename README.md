# Project Tiny Samples
This repository contains samples for Project Tiny.
Please [read through the Project Tiny guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8hen2hLFY5FLkC5gd3JP2Z-IpHfnAX-CpYLK3aOdwA/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the current project state, limitations, and getting started information.

Current samples:
- TinyRacing sample project is intended as a lightweight example of the type of content you can build with Project Tiny. It is a complete game slice showing a number of elements such as accepting input, implementing simple AI, handling collisions, and similar. Please explore and play around with the sample project to get a feel for what developing with pure DOTS looks like.
- Tiny3D sample is a "Hello World" style sample with minimal assets & code
- TinyFactory sample project demonstrates how Animations can be added to a scene (no code).
- TinyGems and TinySpaceship are 2D sample projects that showcases some of the features that can be found inside the 2D Entities package.
